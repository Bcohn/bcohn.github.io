Hi,

Welcome to my page! I live in Somerville, Massachusets, and I work as a research assistant for [Dr. Ziad Obermeyer](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/people/ziad-obermeyer). In the past I have worked at [GNS Healthcare](http://www.gnshealthcare.com/), a machine learning start up, and at [RTI International](http://www.rti.org/), a not for profit research firm. In the fall of 2014 I taught a [class](http://bco.hn/syllabus.html) on data analysis in healthcare at Tufts University.

I am interested in applying predictive analytics to solve public policy problems, and I am generally passionate about machine learning, applied statistics, econometrics, and programming. If you would like to collaborate on an interesting project, or just get in touch, I can be reached at brentjoseph@gmail.com
